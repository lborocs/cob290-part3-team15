# Messaging and Analytics Subsystems

This application contains two subsystems intended to deliver services that can be integrated into an organisation's existing software systems.
The first is a live chat to allow users to communicate in real time, either one-to-one or in group chats.
The second is an analytics dashboard that provides insights for employees and managers, which will allow them to prioritise key tasks and evaluate performance.

These systems are supported by an underlying RestFUL API which allows external systems to utilise its services. This also enables our components to be fully modular, such that any section of either subsystem can be deployed elsewhere with minimal adaptation.
